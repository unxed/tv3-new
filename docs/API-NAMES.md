# How a C++ name becomes a Pascal name

The names of magiblot/tvision and magiblot/tvterm become Pascal names by these rules.

- Classes keep their names.
- Member functions and free functions take a capital first letter.
- Data members take a capital first letter.
- Constants, enumerators and commands keep their names.
- Constructors are `Create`, destructors are `Destroy`.
- Value types are advanced records with class operators.
- Reference parameters that change are `var`; const references are `const`.
- Units are `Tv<Name>`.

## Added

APIs added beside an existing one by rule P5 of `docs/ASYNC.md` are listed here, one per line, as
"added: <name>".

added: TEventQueue.PostEvent
added: TEventQueue.GetPostedEvent
added: TEventQueue.HasPostedEvents
added: TEventQueue.Backend
added: TEventBackend
added: TEventFifo
added: TvObject
added: TvObject.DestroyObject
added: Utf8Enabled
added: TTextCells
added: TTransformAttr
added: TPackedUtf8Func
added: CodePageToPackedUtf8
added: TClipboardBackend
added: TStreamBuf
added: TMemBuf
added: TFileBuf

The last eight are added by the rules of the translation, not by rule P5. A Pascal class cannot be extended in another
unit, so the members of the C++ class TText that write into screen cells are class methods of TTextCells in TvText.
TTransformAttr and TPackedUtf8Func are the procedural types that stand for a function template parameter and for the
code page conversion of a control character, and CodePageToPackedUtf8 is the variable that holds the latter.
TClipboardBackend is the class of the hook for the system clipboard, which THardwareInfo provides in the C++.

TStreamBuf stands for the streambuf of the C++ standard library, which the streams of TvStreams use through the
pointer bp; TMemBuf and TFileBuf are its buffers in memory and on a file (the filebuf). The constants iosGoodBit to
iosEnd of TvStreams stand for the state bits, open modes and seek directions of ios. The stream operators >> and <<
are the members Get and Put of the streams, and the operators void * and ! of pstream are OpVoidPtr and OpNot.

Utf8Enabled is a variable of TvUtf8 that has no counterpart in the C++ API; it switches the text routines between
UTF-8 and the one-byte code page.

TvObject is the class TObject of the C++ and TvObject.DestroyObject is its static function destroy: the names TObject
and Destroy belong to System.TObject and its destructor, and a class of the same name in a unit would hide
System.TObject for every unit that uses it. The members that are private virtual in the C++ (FreeItem, Compare)
are protected, so that a class of another unit can override them.

## Differences

State protected by rule P4 of `docs/ASYNC.md` is listed here, one per line, as "difference: thread safety of
<name>".

difference: thread safety of TWakeUpEventSource.Signal

difference: thread safety of TEventQueue.WakeUp
difference: thread safety of TEventBackend.Feed
