# How a C++ name becomes a Pascal name

The names of magiblot/tvision and magiblot/tvterm become Pascal names by these rules.

- Classes keep their names.
- Member functions and free functions take a capital first letter.
- Data members take a capital first letter.
- Constants, enumerators and commands keep their names.
- Constructors are `Create`, destructors are `Destroy`.
- Value types are advanced records with class operators.
- Reference parameters that change are `var`; const references are `const`.
- Units are `Tv<Name>`.

## Added

APIs added beside an existing one by rule P5 of `docs/ASYNC.md` are listed here, one per line, as
"added: <name>".

added: TEventQueue.PostEvent
added: TEventQueue.GetPostedEvent
added: TEventQueue.HasPostedEvents
added: TEventQueue.Backend
added: TEventBackend
added: TEventFifo
added: TTextCells
added: TTransformAttr
added: TPackedUtf8Func
added: CodePageToPackedUtf8
added: TClipboardBackend

The last five are added by the rules of the translation, not by rule P5. A Pascal class cannot be extended in another
unit, so the members of the C++ class TText that write into screen cells are class methods of TTextCells in TvText.
TTransformAttr and TPackedUtf8Func are the procedural types that stand for a function template parameter and for the
code page conversion of a control character, and CodePageToPackedUtf8 is the variable that holds the latter.
TClipboardBackend is the class of the hook for the system clipboard, which THardwareInfo provides in the C++.

## Differences

<name>".
